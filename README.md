# Grad-vs-Crime Analysis
Welcome!
In this project we search for the relationship between Graduation Rates and Crime Rates from the years 2006-2009. We use pandas to drop NaN values and unnecessary columns and rows. With the help of Matplotlib we create some visualizations of the analyzed data to better display the information. We found that there is a negative correlation in crime rates and percentage of graduates. The more graduates there are, the less crime is.
